subtitle: Introduction to this podcast, as well as our book for the season - The Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide
description: >
    Welcome to the 8-bit Book Club, where each season we read a vintage programming book and discuss it as we go. In this episode, we introduce the Commodore 64
    Programmer's Reference Guide, talk about what was going on in the world when it came out, and go on a wild goose chase to learn who wrote this iconic book.
    Carl talks us through a rather unconventional method for warming up snacks. John recalls borrowing a PET from his grade school. Chris judges us all, and
    finds our character lacking.
